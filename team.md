## Geoffrey YuHasker

Geoff has spent his career at the intersection of computer science and
and finance. Most recently, he has contributed to ads ranking and auction
mechanisms at the two social networks. Prior to that, he traded rates
derivates throughout the credit crisis and spent time pursuing a PhD in computer
security.

The combination of mechanism design, computation finance, and cryptography in
DeFi especially excites him, leading to a number of recent investments.
This has led him to recently start [blogging](https://yuhasker.substack.com/)
on the topic.
